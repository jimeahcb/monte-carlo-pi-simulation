Monte Carlo Simulation to Find π

This is a Python-based Monte Carlo simulation with an interactive Tkinter GUI to approximate the value 
of π by randomly sampling points and calculating circle-to-square ratios for visualization and analysis.

HOW TO RUN SIMULATION:
1. Clone or download this repo:<br>
   A) Open the Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
       <br>Change directory and go to the folder where you want to save the project.
       <br>Copy and paste this command:
           <br>git clone https://github.com/jimeahcb/monte-carlo-pi-simulation.git<br>
    B) Click the green Code button near the top of this page. <br>
       Choose Download ZIP.<br>
       Extract/Unzip the folder somewhere on your computer. <br>
3. Install Python 3 on your device.
4. Open a terminal inside the downloaded folder and run:
